This repository contains the R codes and data sets used in my Your Own Project Submission. 

#########
The submission for the choose-your-own project will be three files: a report in the form of both a PDF document and Rmd file and the R script that performs your machine learning task. You must also provide access to your dataset, either through automatic download in your script or inclusion in a GitHub repository. (Remember, you are strongly discouraged from using well-known datasets, particularly ones that have been used as examples in previous courses or are similar to them. Also remember that you may not submit the same project for both the MovieLens and Choose Your Own project submissions.) We recommend submitting a link to a GitHub repository with these three files and your dataset. Your grade for the project will be based on your report and your script.

Report and Script
Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric defined by the course staff, as well as by the course staff. The staff grade will be your final grade for the project. Note that due to the volume of submissions and the number of graders, it can take up to four weeks to receive your staff grade, although we strive for a faster turnaround time! To receive your grade, you must review and grade the reports of five of your fellow learners after submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers. You are encouraged to give your peers thoughful and specific feedback on their projects.

Please pay attention to the due dates listed! The project submission is due before the end of the course to allow time for peer grading. Also note that you must grade the reports of your peers by the course close date in order to receive your grade.

Honor Code
You are welcome to discuss your project with others, but all submitted work must be your own. Your participation in this course is governed by the terms of the edX Honor Code. If your report is found to violate the terms of the honor code (for example, if you copy a project from another learner), you will receive a zero on the project, may be unenrolled from the course, and will not be eligible to receive a certificate.

Project Due Date
Submissions for the project are due one week before course close, on March 9, 2022, at 23:59 UTC. This allows time for peer grading to occur! Peer grades are due at course close, on March 16, 2022, at 23:59 UTC.
